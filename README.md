## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build a responsive blog preview card component that displays an article preview with an image, category tag, publication date, title, description, and author information. The component should have a clean design with proper styling and hover effects.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design principles

### What I learned

While building this project, I reinforced my understanding of:

- CSS box model and layout techniques
- Responsive design principles
- Working with custom properties in CSS
- Creating card components with proper spacing and typography
- Implementing hover effects and subtle shadows for depth

Here's a code snippet I'm particularly proud of:

```css
.card {
  max-width: 350px;
  margin: 2rem auto;
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  overflow: hidden;
  border-radius: 15px;
  padding: 1rem;
}
